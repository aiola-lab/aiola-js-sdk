# aiOla Streaming Vanilla JS SDK
## Keywords Spotting Example

###### this example demonstrates how to set up keyword spotting using the aiOla Streaming SDK.

#### Spin up the example (using http-server)

Install http-server globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
2. Run in the project directory:
   ```bash
   http-server
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<check_port_in_the_console>`

> **Note**: Due to security restrictions, modern browsers require a secure context (HTTPS or localhost) to access the microphone. Running directly from `file://` protocol won't work for microphone access.
